# File-Compressor-with-C
Write "make" to Terminal to start the program, there is an example reference.txt

A homework from my first year.

Program using Huffman Coding Tree method to compress the file.
Takes the information from the "reference.txt" and creates a Huffman Coding Tree, then program creates "encoded.dat" file which is
the compressed "reference.txt". And then program decodes the "encoded.dat" and creates "decoded.txt" which is same file before compression.

Program shows the binary code for each character in the file, and writes file sizes and difference between them.
