There is a makefile in src directory.
I used Serialization to save progress, when you login the system there will be some item in the depot, employees, branch etc.
There is a customer already created: mail: fbaggins@mail.com | pass: 1234 | ID: C00001
There is an employee in branch1, ID: E00001
You can always create new branch, employee, customer etc.

In report classdiagram is a bit blurry, so i put png file to the directory.

Java Documentation is in the doc directory.
